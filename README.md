## Introduction
#### Purpose
This document is the software specification report for Yucked. Yucked aims to provide a platform to serve users whose social environments are not conductive to good social experiences. We aim to provide users a means to look up businesses and inform them of local events and promotions in the city. The system is intended to serve the needs of students from FSU and the surrounding community.
#### Scope of the System Specified
The need for the system is to ensure that students are informed as possible. Currently, users do not have a way to rate businesses and be alerted when businesses have limited-time promotions all on a social platform. The software will automate a method to ping businesses with promotional updates and present the users with the information obtained.

## General Description
#### Product Perspective
Yucked is a web-based system with interaction to a database containing relevant testing data, the user's phone numbers, and the system being used by the user to find local promotions. The system provides a secure environment for all registrations and for storing and retrieving of confidential user information.
#### Product Functions
Yucked allows a user to log onto the system, search which businesses they want to review, select promotions, and set favorite place. To use the system, a phone number and password is required during registration, and a user can decide their user id. A user can then log on and begin querying the database for promotions and reviews. A system administrator must make requests to local businesses so that promotions can then be scheduled into the system and registered into the database.
#### User Characteristics
The two groups are System Administrators, and Users.
###### Systems Administrators
Can maintain the software, configure the system, access all parts of the system for testing and debugging, and can take on the privileges of Testing Center, Faculty, and Student roles.
###### Users
