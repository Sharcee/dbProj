## Introduction
#### Purpose
This document is the software specification report for Yucked. Yucked aims to provide a platform to serve users whose social environments are not conductive to good social experiences. We aim to provide users a means to look up businesses and inform them of local events and promotions in the city. The system is intended to serve the needs of students from FSU and the surrounding community.
#### Scope of the System Specified
The need for the system is to ensure that students are informed as possible. Currently, users do not have a way to rate businesses and be alerted when businesses have limited-time promotions all on a social platform. The software will automate a method to ping businesses with promotional updates and present the users with the information obtained.
